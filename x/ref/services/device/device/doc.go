instances.

Usage:
   device acl [flags] <command>

   set         Set Permissions for the given target.

Device acl get

Get Permissions for the given target.

Usage:
   device acl get [flags] <device manager name>

<device manager name> can be a Vanadium name for a device manager, application
installation or instance.

Device acl set

Set Permissions for the given target

Usage:
   device acl set [flags] <device manager name>  (<blessing> [!]<tag>(,[!]<tag>)*

<device manager name> can be a Vanadium name for a device manager, application
installation or instance.

<blessing> is a blessing pattern. If the same pattern is repeated multiple times
in the command, then the only the last occurrence will be honored.

<tag> is a subset of defined access types ("Admin", "Read", "Write" etc.). If
the access right is prefixed with a '!' then <blessing> is added to the NotIn
list for that right. Using "^" as a "tag" causes all occurrences of <blessing>
in the current AccessList to be cleared.

Examples: set root/self ^ will remove "root/self" from the In and NotIn lists
for all access rights.

set root/self Read,!Write will add "root/self" to the In list for Read access
and the NotIn list for Write access (and remove "root/self" from both the In and
NotIn lists of all other access rights)

The device acl set flags are:
 -f=false
   Instead of making the AccessLists additive, do a complete replacement based
   on the specified settings.

Device publish

Publishes the given application(s) to the binary and application servers. The
binaries should be in $JIRI_ROOT/release/go/bin/[<GOOS>_<GOARCH>] by default

of the application envelope, and as the title in the envelope. However,
<envelope-name> and <title> can be specified explicitly using :<envelope-name>
and @<title>. The binary is published as <binserv>/<binary
name>/<GOOS>-<GOARCH>/<TIMESTAMP>. The application envelope is published as
<appserv>/<envelope-name>/<TIMESTAMP>. Optionally, adds blessing patterns to the
Read and Resolve AccessLists.

Usage:
   device publish [flags] <binary name>[:<envelope-name>][@<title>] ...

The device publish flags are:
 -add-publisher=true
   If true, add a publisher blessing to the application envelope
 -appserv=applications
   Name of application service.

   AccessList.

   from among: [Active Uninstalled]. If the value is prefixed by '!', the list
   acts as a blacklist (all matching installations get filtered out).
 -instance-state=
   If non-empty, specifies allowed instance states (all other instances get
   filtered out). The value of the flag is a comma-separated list of values from
   among: [Launching Running Dying NotRunning Updating Deleted]. If the value is
   prefixed by '!', the list acts as a blacklist (all matching instances get
   filtered out).
 -only-installations=false
   If set, only consider installations.
 -only-instances=false
   If set, only consider instances.
 -parallelism=FULL
   Specifies the level of parallelism for the handler execution. One of: [BYKIND

      compact   - Good for compact cmdline output.
      full      - Good for cmdline output, shows all global flags.
      godoc     - Good for godoc processing.
      shortonly - Only output short description.
   Override the default by setting the CMDLINE_STYLE environment variable.
